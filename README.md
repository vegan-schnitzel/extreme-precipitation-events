# Extreme Precipitation Events

Quoting the abstract of the report:

*Extreme precipitation events are a major consequence of recent global warming. It is therefore important to quantify the change in extreme events in regard to a rising global CO2 concentration. We use precipitation data from a climate model of intermediate complexity, the Planet Simulator, in order to count the number of extreme events for simulations with varying CO2 concentrations. The analysis shows an increase in extreme precipitation events for higher CO2 concentrations. Moreover, the rate of change is just slightly higher for a planet with Pre-Industrial ice sheet configuration than for one with Last Glacial Maximum ice sheets. The influence of different ice configurations is dominated by the influence of increasing CO2 concentration. Further studies could include a general ocean circulation model and higher model resolutions.*
